  "Views, filters & sorts (continued)\n\nViews, filters & sortsPlayIn this ArticleYou can view the same database in multiple ways, and switch back and forth between them depending on your needs. Within a view, you can add filters and sorts to easily categorize your content 📁ContentsTypes of database viewsCreate and switch between viewsCustomize your database viewsLink to your database viewOpen pages asFiltersAdd a filterAdd an advanced filterSortsGroupsSearch your databaseFreeze columnTypes of database viewsThere are six different ways to visualize your content within a database. Here's a high level overview of each layout:Table:Tables allow you to see your database pages as rows, with every property represented by a column.Board:This view groups your items by property. For example, you could use it as a Kanban board to move tasks from one status to another as you make progress on them.Timeline:Use your database to plot project milestones on a timeline so you can see when they’re happening and how long they’ll take to complete.Calendar:Calendar view displays your items based on theirDateproperty.List:Lists are a very clean, minimal layout of your database items.Gallery:This view is useful for highlighting images. You can edit your gallery to show images contained in theFiles & mediaproperty — otherwise, the gallery will show any content that the database page contains.Chart:This view visualizes your database items in a bar, line, or donut chart so you can easily analyze and report on the data.Create and switch between viewsWhen you first create a database, you'll need to choose the layout of the default view. After this, you can create a new view by selecting+next to your existing views. Depending on your screen size, you may have to open the dropdown next to your current view and selectAdd view.You can also provide others with information by giving your view a description. To do this:Select a view →Edit view.Selectⓘnext to your view’s name, then enter your description.When you hover over a view, you will see its description.You can reorder your views by dragging them. If you have a lot of views, you can select{#} more...next to your views to do this.In your sidebar, views show up as nested items inside any full page database. You can tell they are views because they'll have a•to their left. Click on any view in your sidebar to jump right to it.Customize your database viewsWhen you’re in a given view, click its name to rename, duplicate, delete, copy its link, or edit its components. You can also edit view components by clicking the•••at the top right of the database.Each view of the database has several components that you can customize:Layout:Choose how you want your database to be visually organized.Properties:Show or hide database properties for each view.Filters:Add criteria based on property values to show or hide data.Sorts:Sort by a property to change the order that pages are displayed in.Groups:Group your data by the values in a property.Link to your database viewYou can copy an anchor link to this specific view of your database so you can share it elsewhere.Click the•••icon at the top right of your table.ClickCopy link to {view}and the URL will copy to your clipboard so you can paste it.Open pages asWithin each view, you can choose how you'd like database pages to open. There are three options:Side peek:Open pages on the right side of the database. The rest of the database view continues to be interactive on the left.Center peek:Open pages in a focused, center modal.Full page:Open pages as full pages directly.To change the setting per view, click the ••• at the top right of your database, and open the Layout menu.Scroll down and change theOpen pages insetting.Note:Table, Board, List & Timeline layouts will open pages in side peek by default. Gallery & Calendar layouts will open pages in center peek by default.FiltersNotion makes it easy to filter your database so it only displays the items that meet specified criteria, i.e. have (or don't have) certain properties. These filters can be as simple or complex as you like!Add a filterTo filter the entries you see in a database view:ClickFilterat the top of your database.In the dropdown that appears, choose the property you'd like to filter by.This filter will now show up at the top of your database. Click the filter icon to see and edit all of the filters that have been applied to your database.Add another filter by clicking the filter icon. You can have as many filters as you'd like!Note:In a shared database, any changes you make to filters and sorts in views won’t affect other people on the team until you clickSave for everyone.Add an advanced filterPlayYou can create more specific database views and combineANDandORlogic by using filter groups. These can be nested up to three layers deep! Here's how:Click the filter icon at the top of your database →Add advanced filter.A new menu will pop up. Here, you can choose the properties that you'd like to filter by, and customize theANDandORlogic of the advanced filter.In the example below, we're filtering the table view of our Roadmap so that all the entries have to meet the criteria that include bothANDandORlogic.Tip: You can quickly turn a filter into a filter group by clicking the•••to the right of the filter, and selectingAdd to advanced filter.SortsYou can sort your database so that items are displayed based on properties appearing in ascending or descending order.For example, you can order them based on priority, or last edited, or alphabetically.Click⇅at the top of your database.In the dropdown that appears, choose the property you'd like to sort by.This sort will now show up at the top of your database. Click to edit it.You can add as many sorts as you want, or remove them by clicking theXto their right.Change the order that multiple sorts are applied by dragging them up or down using⋮⋮.Note:Different properties sort by different logic, depending on their value type.Text properties such asNameandTextsort alphabetically.Number properties sort numerically.ForSelectandMulti-selectproperties, you get to define what sorting order means. Click on the property, then drag options up or down to set the sort order.GroupsYou can group your database by different properties on your table to visualize them in different ways.Click the•••menu and findGroup. You can group by nearly any property type.The database will now group by values of that property. Each group includes a👁️to the left, so you can quickly hide groups and focus on what you need.You can sort your database groups by selectingSortand choosing to sort manually or sort by the options provided (alphabetical, ascending, and more).Empty groups can also be hidden from view with theHide empty groupstoggle.Search your databaseYou can search for specific content in your database.Click🔎at the top right and type the word(s) you're looking for in page titles or properties.You'll see your database change in real-time to only show the items that fit that criteria.Freeze columnIf you have a large database, it's probably tedious to keep moving back and forth between properties to compare their data.Instead you can freeze one column, which will cause it to stay visible on the left side no matter where you scroll in the database.To freeze a column, click the name of the column and clickFreeze up to column.To unfreeze a column, click the name of the column and clickUnfreeze column.",

Here, you might look at tasks assigned to each of your reports, overall projects each team member is on, and more.3 ways to use charts for your teamSo how can you use charts (and dashboards!), to enhance your work? Let’s consider three different kinds of projects that we commonly see managed inside of Notion.Create an OKR dashboard for your leadership teamCharts help visualizeOKRs, making it easier to track progress, enhance decision-making, and improve accountability. By analyzing trends and communicating goals clearly, teams can stay agile and keep leadership informed without creating an additional burden of reporting.You might consider creating a bar chart of OKR status by team to identify and mitigate potential risks. Similarly, a line chart of key result progress over time can help identify which teams have momentum, and those that might be slowing down.Help your leadership team quickly assess the progress of company level goals with an OKR dashboard.Visualize what’s coming with your product roadmapCharts offer a strategic view of yourproduct roadmap, enabling your team to allocate resources efficiently and prioritize features with precision. By visualizing upcoming features and their timelines, you can ensure that your team stays on track and meets key milestones, ultimately leading to a more streamlined and effective development process.Anticipate launch bottlenecks in your product schedule with a simple visual like this one.Deepen understanding of your content libraryIf you manage yourcontent calendarin Notion, you can use charts to understand both in progress and published content at a glance.You might use a line chart track content scheduling and publishing to maintain a consistent release schedule. This helps identify delays or inconsistencies in your workflow.At the same time, you can visualize content distribution by tagging pieces based on channel in a bar chart. This ensures that each audience segment receives the appropriate amount of content and could help you refactor plans to make sure all of your audience’s needs are met.Bar charts can help you better understand and plan out the content your team is working on.Enhance your existing project management suite with chartsWhile this guide covered the bulk of what you need to know to get started, the possibilities for using charts are pretty endless, especially when combined with other project management features in Notion. Here are a few more advanced ways to use charts in your workspace:Turn synced databases into a chart —Synced databasespull information from tools like Jira, Asana, and GitHub into your Notion workspace to let you visualize 3rd party tasks as a Notion database. Consider turning these synced databases into charts so that your project manager can get a view of what’s happening across all of these different tools in one glance.Any database, including synced ones — like from Jira or Asana — can be turned into a chart.Visualize AI-generated content tags —WithAI autofill, you can generate tags for every row in your database based on page content in seconds. Why not use charts to visualize those tags? This makes for quick exploration of large data sets with very little work to audit and tag your data in the first place.AI autofill and charts can come together to help make sense of large sets of database pages instantly.Embed charts from different data sources in your dashboard —You canembedcharts from external data sources such as Tableau, Mixpanel, or Google Analytics into Notion. Add these alongside the charts you’re using for project tracking to create a comprehensive view of your team’s performance, without leaving the Notion app.Exporting charts from NotionClick to expandWhen used thoughtfully, charts can act as a powerful addition to your Notion workspace, enhancing your ability to manage projects and visualize data. Utilize them to gain clearer insights and streamline your workflow. For now, if you’re not sure where to start, check out the templates below!Templates with chartsYou can add a chart to any of your existing databases, or get started with some of our favorites:ThisOKR trackerhelps you track your team or company goals in one streamlined place.Content teams can use thecontent calendar to keep track of both in-flight and published pieces.Or try theproduct roadmap,personal finance dashboard, orsales CRMto get inspired with more charts use-cases.Share this guideGive FeedbackWas this resource helpful?Start with a templateBrowse over 10,000 templates in ourtemplate gallerySchool Planner$10.19·JulsPersonal Goals MindmapPowerplant SolutionSimple Company Landing PageNotionize ConsultingB2B Marketing Automation Planner$25.00·Amado DigitalPersonal CRM$5.00·iamsourabhshenacademia templateTaliRamadan 2023Samaa MinhaasAgile sprints$24.00·OmnaLanguage learningFronkSomething we didn't cover?Visit the help centerSubscribe on YoutubeChat with us",

Let’s consider three different kinds of projects that we commonly see managed inside of Notion.Create an OKR dashboard for your leadership teamCharts help visualizeOKRs, making it easier to track progress, enhance decision-making, and improve accountability. By analyzing trends and communicating goals clearly, teams can stay agile and keep leadership informed without creating an additional burden of reporting.You might consider creating a bar chart of OKR status by team to identify and mitigate potential risks. Similarly, a line chart of key result progress over time can help identify which teams have momentum, and those that might be slowing down.Help your leadership team quickly assess the progress of company level goals with an OKR dashboard.Visualize what’s coming with your product roadmapCharts offer a strategic view of yourproduct roadmap, enabling your team to allocate resources efficiently and prioritize features with precision. By visualizing upcoming features and their timelines, you can ensure that your team stays on track and meets key milestones, ultimately leading to a more streamlined and effective development process.Anticipate launch bottlenecks in your product schedule with a simple visual like this one.Deepen understanding of your content libraryIf you manage yourcontent calendarin Notion, you can use charts to understand both in progress and published content at a glance.You might use a line chart track content scheduling and publishing to maintain a consistent release schedule. This helps identify delays or inconsistencies in your workflow.At the same time, you can visualize content distribution by tagging pieces based on channel in a bar chart. This ensures that each audience segment receives the appropriate amount of content and could help you refactor plans to make sure all of your audience’s needs are met.Bar charts can help you better understand and plan out the content your team is working on.Enhance your existing project management suite with chartsWhile this guide covered the bulk of what you need to know to get started, the possibilities for using charts are pretty endless, especially when combined with other project management features in Notion. Here are a few more advanced ways to use charts in your workspace:Turn synced databases into a chart —Synced databasespull information from tools like Jira, Asana, and GitHub into your Notion workspace to let you visualize 3rd party tasks as a Notion database. Consider turning these synced databases into charts so that your project manager can get a view of what’s happening across all of these different tools in one glance.Any database, including synced ones — like from Jira or Asana — can be turned into a chart.Visualize AI-generated content tags —WithAI autofill, you can generate tags for every row in your database based on page content in seconds. Why not use charts to visualize those tags? This makes for quick exploration of large data sets with very little work to audit and tag your data in the first place.AI autofill and charts can come together to help make sense of large sets of database pages instantly.Embed charts from different data sources in your dashboard —You canembedcharts from external data sources such as Tableau, Mixpanel, or Google Analytics into Notion. Add these alongside the charts you’re using for project tracking to create a comprehensive view of your team’s performance, without leaving the Notion app.Exporting charts from NotionClick to expandWhen used thoughtfully, charts can act as a powerful addition to your Notion workspace, enhancing your ability to manage projects and visualize data.

  "Use charts to visualize data and track progress directly in Notion (continued)\n\nUse charts to visualize data and track progress directly in NotionWhether you need to track project timelines, analyze team performance, or simply make sense of large datasets, charts offer a solution that transforms your database pages into actionable information.7 min readCharts help you make sense of all of the work your team is tracking in Notion.In this guideHow your database becomes a chartCombine charts to create a dashboard3 ways to use charts for your teamCreate an OKR dashboard for your leadership teamVisualize what’s coming with your product roadmapDeepen understanding of your content libraryEnhance your existing project management suite with chartsWith Notion’s connected workspace, you can get your projects to the finish line faster and with less context switching. But without visualizations, managing large amounts of tasks can be cumbersome. Charts take your project management to the next level, helping you to monitor project progress, spot trends, and make decisions.With Notion charts you can:Visualize your project in realtime —Forget about separate tools or tedious copy-pasting. When you add charts from Notion databases, they’ll update automatically whenever a change is made to the underlying data or tasks.Make more informed decisions —Looking at hundreds of tasks in a database can be overwhelming. Charts let you easily spot trends, monitor progress, and make decisions to move forward quicker than you might be able to otherwise.Break free from complicated analytics tools —We all love our data partners, but we’d prefer not to need them for absolutely everything. With charts, anyone can make beautiful visualizations in a few clicks using the UI they already know (and, hopefully, love!)In this guide, we’ll cover how to make a chart, and discuss ways that you can use them to improve your project management in Notion.How your database becomes a chartCharts work like any otherdatabase view— meaning you can view the same data in multiple ways, and switch back and forth between them depending on your needs. To create a view, simply navigate to the+button in your database and select “Chart.” Within your chart view, you can filter your data, and customize your chart to craft a perfect picture of your project’s progress.Create a chart just like you would any other database view.Looking for charts docs?Click to expandNotion charts come with 4 layout options, each serving a unique purpose:Donut charts for simple distribution— Donut charts are a simple option for visualizing the distribution of tasks across different categories or team members, providing a clear view of resource allocation. For example, you might use one to analyze and balance the task load across your engineering team in a given sprint.Use a donut chart to visualize information like assignee, tag, or status.Horizontal and vertical bar charts for multi-dimensional categorization— Bar charts let you view database items with sub-groups, helping you quickly compare two categories, like status and task type. You might use a one of these to understand OKR progress by team and identify a bottleneck in your operating model.Bar charts give you a simple understanding of information across multiple database properties.Line charts for progress over time —Line charts are best for tracking the progress of tasks over time, and can even be used to compare sub-groups. Like the number of pieces published each week in a given quarter, broken down by channel; or the number of tasks completed over time, by engineer.Line charts help display information over time — like content published in a year.As mentioned, you’ll also be able to sort and filter the data in your chart, add axis and data labels, and even customize your color palate. Learn more in the video below:PlayNow that you’ve got the basics, let’s dive in to how charts help your work in the real world.Combine charts to create a dashboardSince charts are database views, you can create them anywhere in Notion by navigating to the page where you want the view to appear and typing/chart. Here you’ll be prompted to link an existing database. Do this multiple times, and you’ll be able to make a dashboard that lets you visualize data from multiple databases, or from the same database (in multiple ways!) in a single place.Add charts to your docs and meeting notes to help keep your team on the same page.The beauty of Notion’s connected workspace means that unlike a chart created based on static data in a spreadsheet, these dashboards are living records of the work going on across your team, and they update in realtime. Use them for one database, or many. You might want to:Centralize scattered tracking systems —if you have teams working across different project trackers (like your engineering tasks, and marketing campaign calendar), consider creating a dashboard to visualize the status of both projects simultaneously.Get an in-depth view of important work— similarly, you might want to create a dashboard to view different cuts of the same database. Like an OKR dashboard that highlights different project statuses, key result progression, and tasks completed over time.Visualize team progress across projects— as a team manager, you could create a dashboard to understand individual performance, irrespective of project statuses.

Ask AI for anything, and continue asking follow up prompts until you’re satisfied with the outputHow does artificial intelligence work?The computer finds patterns in a large set of data called training data to make a model.The computer tests the model by asking a question it already knows the answer to and analyzing how accurate its answer is, using test data.With more inputs and training data, it learns and improves the model over time.Read more about how artificial intelligence works, as well as its current limitations,here.",

Here's a high level overview of each layout:Table:Tables allow you to see your database pages as rows, with every property represented by a column.Board:This view groups your items by property. For example, you could use it as a Kanban board to move tasks from one status to another as you make progress on them.Timeline:Use your database to plot project milestones on a timeline so you can see when they’re happening and how long they’ll take to complete.Calendar:Calendar view displays your items based on theirDateproperty.List:Lists are a very clean, minimal layout of your database items.Gallery:This view is useful for highlighting images. You can edit your gallery to show images contained in theFiles & mediaproperty — otherwise, the gallery will show any content that the database page contains.Chart:This view visualizes your database items in a bar, line, or donut chart so you can easily analyze and report on the data.Create and switch between viewsWhen you first create a database, you'll need to choose the layout of the default view. After this, you can create a new view by selecting+next to your existing views. Depending on your screen size, you may have to open the dropdown next to your current view and selectAdd view.You can also provide others with information by giving your view a description. To do this:Select a view →Edit view.Selectⓘnext to your view’s name, then enter your description.When you hover over a view, you will see its description.You can reorder your views by dragging them.

  "Relations & rollups (continued)\n\nRelations & rollupsPlayIn this ArticleHave you ever wanted to connect the data between two tables? You're in luck! Notion's relation property is designed to help you express useful relationships between items in different databases 🛠Jump to FAQsContentsWhat is a database relation?Example use casesCreate a relationTwo-way relationsView and remove related pagesDisplay options for relationsCustomize displayed properties for relationsRelate a database to itselfRollupsRollup typesAggregate rollupsWhat is a database relation?Let's say you have two databases for your theoretical business 😉One that tracks customersOne that tracks items purchasedYou want to know both which customers bought which items, as well as which items were purchased by which customers. This is a job for relations!In the two tables above, the columns labeled↗ Items Purchasedand↗ Customersare relation properties, which can be added like any other database property.Here, when you add an item bought into theCustomersdatabase, the customers who bought them automatically appear in the↗ Customerscolumn in theItemsdatabase.Example use casesConnect yourdatabase of restaurantswith yourdatabase of neighborhoodsso you can see which restaurants are in which neighborhoods at a glance.Connect yourdatabase of meeting noteswith yourdatabase of clientsto provide quick access to the notes relevant to each client.Connect yourdatabase of taskswith yourdatabase of bigger projectsto understand how projects are broken down into tasks, and how tasks contribute to projects.Connect yourdatabase of candidateswith yourdatabase of interviewersto keep track of who interviewed whom.Create a relationTo relate two databases, you need two databases. So let's assume you've made theCustomersandItemsdatabases above for the purpose of this walkthrough.Add a new column/property to yourCustomersdatabase and give it a name, likeItems Purchased.Search forRelation.Then, search for the database you want to create the relation with.You'll see a preview of the relation. In this case, we've created a relation from the Customer database to the Items database.Click the blueAdd relationbutton to finalize the creation of the new relation property.Now when you click in a cell in this relation column, you'll bring up a menu where you can search for and choose items from the other database to add.For example, this is how you can add which clothes each customer bought.To add an item, click the name in the list. To delete an item, hover over and then click the–button on the right.Tip:To change the database you're connecting to, re-selectRelationas the property type for that particularly property. You'll be prompted to choose a new database.Two-way relationsRelations are created as one-way by default. But you can easily toggle on a corresponding relation in the destination database.With two-way relations, the edits work both ways! So if you add a customer to theItemsdatabase in the relation column, the change pops up in yourCustomersdatabase.Follow the above instructions to create a new relation property.Click the toggle that saysShow on [name of related database]. In our example, this saysShow on Items DB.Give this corresponding relation a name.Below, you'll see a preview of the two-way relation. In this case, we've created a relation from the Customer database to the Items database,anda relation from the Items database to the Customer database.Click the blueAdd relationbutton to finalize the creation of these two new relation properties.View and remove related pagesWhen you create a relation, you're essentially adding Notion pages stored in one database into the property field of another.These pages can be opened and edited like any other! Click on the page in the relation column. Then click on it again in the window that pops up.You can also remove any related page by hovering over and clicking the–at the right.You can choose to limit the number of pages that can be included in your relations property – with the option to select1 pageor to haveNo limit.If you select the option to limit it to1 page, people using your database will only be able to select 1 page in the relation. This is especially useful for situations where only one page should be related to one another, for example - if only one order number should be associated with each purchase.Display options for relationsRelations can be displayed on pages in three different ways.To change the display:While on a database page, click on the relation.ClickShow asand select one of the following:As property: The relation will be displayed at the top of the page, alongside all the page properties.As page section: The relation will be displayed right above the page body, as its own section. Best option if you want the relation to standout.Minimal: The relation will be display right above the page body, but with the content hidden.Note:If you want to change a relation fromMinimalto another display, click•••->Customize page.Customize displayed properties for relationsWhen you set up a relation in your database, you can also choose to display certain properties of linked pages. For example, let’s say you have a database of frequently asked questions at your company. Each FAQ has a relation to a page that further explains the answer to the question. You might want people to also be able to see the owner of each page, so they know who to reach out to with more questions. You can set your FAQ database up so that the owner is visible along with the relevant page!To do this:Open a page in a database that has a relation property.Click the field next to that property to link a page → click•••.In the menu that appears, drag the properties of the related database into or out ofShown in relationorHidden in relation.Once you’re done, you’ll see your desired properties appear in the relation field. This will apply to all of the pages in your current database.Relate a database to itselfLet's say you want items in the same database to have relationships with each other. For example, you have a tasks database and you want each task to relate to other tasks.Start off by creating a new relation.Then search for and choose the database you're currently working in.You'll now see that the database is related toThis database.Just as with relations between two databases, you can choose to make this a one-way relation or two-way relation.To make it a two-way relation, toggle onSeparate properties. You'll see a second property show up.RollupsRollups help you aggregate data in your databases based on relations. Going back to our customers and items example above, let's say you wanted to know how much each customer spent based on what they bought.First, create the relation so you know who bought what.Add a new column/property and chooseRollupfrom theProperty typemenu. Give it a descriptive name.Clicking on any cell in the rollup column will bring up a new menu asking you for:The relation property you want to roll up.The property of those related pages you want to roll up.The calculation you want to apply to them.So, for our example, you'd choose to roll up the relation propertyItems Purchasedand thePriceproperty within those pages. Then you'd chooseSumas the calculation.Doing this adds up the prices of each item related to a customer's name, giving you the total dollars they spent in your rollup column.Rollup typesThere are different calculations you can apply as a rollup. Here are all of them:Show original: This just shows all related pages in the same cell. It's the same as the relation property itself.Show unique values: This shows each unique value in the selected property for all related pages.Count all: Counts the total number of values in the selected property for all related pages.Count values: Counts the number of non-empty values in the selected property for all related pages.Count unique values: Counts the number of unique values in the selected property for all related pages.Count empty: Counts the number of related pages with an empty value for the property selected. So, if one item a customer bought didn't have a price and that was the property selected, the rollup column would say 1.Count not empty: Counts the number of related pages with assigned values for the property you selected.Percent empty: Shows the percentage of related pages with no value in the property you selected.Percent not empty: Shows the percentage of related pages with a value in the property you selected.These rollup calculations are only available forNumberproperties:Sum: Computes the sum of the numeric properties for related pages (like above).Average: Computes the average of the numeric properties for related pages.Median: Finds the median of the numeric properties for related pages.Min: Finds the lowest number in the numeric property for related pages.Max: Finds the highest number in the numeric property for related pages.Range: Computes the range between the highest and lowest numbers in the numeric property for related pages (Max-Min).These rollup calculations are only available forDateproperties:Earliest date: Finds the earliest date/time in the date property for all related pages.Latest date: Finds the latest date/time in the date property for all related pages.Date range: Computes the span of time between the latest and earliest dates in the date property for related pages.Aggregate rollupsIn both tables and boards, you can apply calculations to your rollup column to get a sense of sums, ranges, averages, etc. for your entire database.Let's say you want to find the total money spent by all customers in our example.At the bottom of your Customers table, under your rollup column, clickCalculate.ChooseSumto add all the values in that column together and get a grand total.FAQsCan I export or import relations?When you export a relational database as a CSV file, the relation properties will export as plain text URLs. For now, you can't re-import that CSV back into Notion to re-establish the relations with other databases.Can I duplicate a database with a relation?Yes, but the following will happen which can be kind of confusing:If you create a copy of the Customers database in the example above, you'll see a new relation property automatically appear in the Items database.This happens because relations sync two ways in Notion. When a database is duplicated, you also duplicate its relationships with other databases. You'll get the hang of it! 💪Can I rollup a rollup?Unfortunately not, as this could create unintended loops. We recommend sticking to rolling up other properties 😊",

For example, you might have a list of contacts in a Notion database and set up an automation where the trigger is a phone number starting with the numbers 732, and the action is that person’s state being set to New Jersey.You can also have more than one condition for your trigger so that two or more things must be true for the automation to occur.Database automation actionsAutomations can take one action or multiple actions. You can choose from a variety of actions:Edit propertywill edit the properties of pages in the database you are currently in.Add page towill add a page to a database of your choosing, and edit the properties of that page.Edit pages inwill edit pages and properties in a database of your choosing.Send notification towill send a notification to specific people in your Notion workspace. Your recipient can be up to 20 people in your workspace, or people who are associated with a certain People property in your database. Add a message that you want to go along with the notification.Send Slack notification to…will send a notification to the Slack channel you want.If you choose anEdit propertytrigger, you can indicate how you want those properties to be updated.For multi-select, people, and relation properties, you can add or remove individual values instead of adding or removing all values at once. For example, you might have a task database where if the task name contains the word “blog”, your name is added to the people property, even if there are other people already assigned to that task.Get more inspiration for using database workflows inthis guide →Edit, pause, or delete database automationsTo see and manage all of the automations for a database:Click⚡at the top of a database.This⚡will only appear if you have active automations.Hover over the automation and click•••.SelectEdit,Pause, orDelete.FAQsHow frequently is the database scanned for “changes” in properties?Database automations work over a three second window. For example, within this three second window, a user can remove a trigger and delete any changes, resulting in no property change to the automation.Do automations work on pages in the entire database, or pages in a single database view?Either one. During the creation process, you can specify if the automation should run on pages in the entire database, or in a specific view. If any filters in that view change, the automation will then apply to the adjusted list of pages.Can guests with full access to a database create automations?Unfortunately, guests can't create database automations.",

Other property types are supported but their data type will be converted.TextFor example,\"Hello world\"NumberFor example,1, -2.5Can be displayed using the formatting options of the Formula property (e.g. as a percentage, currency, or with a ring or bar).DateDisplays as a date with time (like August 29, 2023 1:33 PM) and can be reformatted to text using thedateFormat()function.Dates can be date ranges, which can be constructed using thedateRange()function.Dates cannot store seconds or milliseconds.PeopleYou can usename()oremail()to retrieve data off any People types.Displays as people’s names with their photos.BooleansCan betrueorfalse.Displays as a filled or unfilled checkbox.PagesRepresents Notion pages, like relations.You can retrieve the properties of a given Notion page by using.on them!Displays as a rich page link with the page's icon.Lists(or arrays)Lists can hold items of any type, including more lists. Multi-select, People, Relation, and most Rollup properties will return list values.You can use list functions likeat(),filter(),map()to manipulate lists.Use theincludes()function to check whether these values contain a specific value instead of equality checks.Example:prop(\"Tags\").includes(\"Movie\")List items display comma-separated for texts, numbers, and dates. For people, checkboxes, and pages, they display space-separated.EmptyThe empty value is not displayed in the output of a formula property, but can be used in the computations themselves.You can check for emptyness on any piece of data with theempty()function.For example,toNumber(\"\")orparseDate(\"Not a date\")will returnEmpty.",

For example, if your sprints used to run for two weeks starting on Mondays, but you want your sprints to run for two weeks starting on Thursdays, your current sprint will run until two weeks after the upcoming Thursday, so that your next sprint can begin on Thursday as you indicated.Incomplete tasks: Choose what will happen to any incomplete tasks from your sprints. You can put them in the next sprint, move them to your backlog, or keep them in their original sprint.Automated sprints: Turn this on if you want sprints to complete automatically before the next one is automatically created and started.Turn off sprints: Choose this to turn off a sprint. Once you turn sprints off, your sprints database, sprint board, and relations between tasks and sprints will be permanently deleted. If you choose to turn sprints on again, you’ll start with a brand new database, board, and relations.Note:You can’t adjust the dates in your sprints database because these dates are either populated based on the settings above, or set when you manually complete a sprint.If you need to break your sprint cadence temporarily, like for the holidays, we suggest turning off automatic sprints and waiting until you’re ready to resume your normal sprint cadence before starting your next sprint.Learn moreHow engineering and product teams use Notion for sprint planningConnect projects and docs to get more done, faster",

If your databases aren’t feeling very fast when you use them, there are a few reasons why this might be happening, and a few ways you can make improvements.Things that can slow your database downNumber of pages: If your database has a ton of pages, it might be slower to load.Number of properties: The more visible properties your database has, the longer it might take to load.Complex sorts and filters: If your database has a sort or filter on properties like title, text, formula, or rollup, the logic behind it can make load times longer.Things you can do to speed up your database setupAvoid building too many databases into high-traffic pagesIf you have a large workspace, avoid having lots ofinline databases, like dashboards, in high-traffic pages. The more simultaneously viewed databases, the more stress on your setup.Try housing each database in its own page first. Once you’ve done that, if you’d like all of the databases to be displayed in one page, you can:Type/linkedin that page and selectLinked view of a databaseto create alinked database.Create database views in this linked database and configure them to point to your desired source databases. Different database views can point to different source databases!When using a single linked database, only one database view is open at a time, and therefore only that one database is listening for updates. You should see an improvement in performance with this setup.Avoid complex reference chainsFormulas and rollups are extremely powerful, but the more complex they are, the slower your database may be. For example, a formula that depends on several other formulas that each depend on rollups may take longer to calculate.Minimize the number of filters and sorts on formulas and rollupsDatabases that arefiltered and sortedonformulaandrollupproperties may take a bit longer to load.Filter on simple propertiesAdding filters based on simple properties such as select, multi-select, status, number, and date may improve the speed of your database. Even if you have complex filters, this may help by reducing the number of pages that need to be processed.Hide unnecessary propertiesIf some properties are less important in your database view, hiding them may improve responsiveness and interactivity.Delete any unused pagesWe suggest removing any unnecessary or duplicative pages from your database to keep it as simple and up-to-date as possible.

You can disable this setting in the Settings tab of Settings & Members in the left sidebar.I want to share a page with a client, but they don't use Notion.You can enable Share to the web in the Share menu, and share the URL with them. As long as you keep the Search engine indexing setting disabled (always disabled by default), only people with that exact URL will be able to access the page. They'll be able to view the page, even if they don't have a Notion account. However, they won't be able to make any edits, leave comments, or sort/filter a database.My Export button is missing, it doesn't appear in any menus.You may have theDisable Exportsetting enabled in theSettingstab ofSettings & Membersin your left sidebar.

How do I join a workspace?You can only join a workspace via theJoin or create workspacebutton if that workspace has theAllowed Email Domainssetting enabled to allow users with your email domain join the workspace automatically.Otherwise, you'll need to ask an admin from the workspace to send you an invite.How do I share with individuals and not whole groups?You can share a private page with individual members of your workspace by clickingShareat the top right and thenInvite a Person. Search for their name, set a level of access for them and pressInvite.You can also share a private page with a guest through the same mechanism, only you should type their email instead of searching their name and pressInvite.Why do I need to disable workspace-level access?You don't have to. Just know that whatever level of access is specified forEveryone at [workspace]is the lowest level of access for everyone in your workspace. If you want some pages to not be visible to certain people, then we recommend disabling it. You can always grant some groups or individuals more access.Why are these pages in the Shared section of my left-hand sidebar?Those are pages shared with only specific groups or individuals. They aren't visible to the rest of the people in your workspace. In order for pages shared with groups to show up in this part of your sidebar, you need to disableEveryone at [workspace]. Otherwise, everyone in your workspace will still see it.As a quick refresher, any page in theWorkspacesection of your sidebar can be viewed in some respect by everyone in your workspace. Any page in thePrivatesection of your sidebar is for your eyes only.How can groups be used instead of multiple separate workspaces?We've seen people create multiple workspaces instead of groups to set granular permissions. For instance, they create separate workspaces for Design, Marketing, and their executive team so these groups can't access, edit, or get distracted by each other's work. There's a quick workaround for this using groups:DisableWorkspace access. That way pages won't show for people and groups who aren't specifically granted access.On every page, grant different levels of access per group. Those access levels will hold true for all the sub-pages on that page.So, for example, you could have a section of your workspace just for the engineering team. Create a group of all your engineers, then on the top-level page for that team, turn onFull accessfor only that group. Nest pages inside that page, and only the engineering team can access them, too!Can I create a shared private page using groups?Yes. If you create a page in thePrivatesection of your sidebar, you can go toShareand toggle on access for a group inside your workspace. Choose their access level like you would on any other page. You'll see the page automatically move to theSharedsection of your sidebar. Only you and the members of that group will be able to see it.How can I allow members in my workspace to request guests for approval?As a workspace owner, you can disable guests for your workspace in yourworkspace security settings, but still allow members to send guest invite requests for review by the workspace owners. This provides a standardized way for guests to get access to content within your workspace, without being an all or nothing approach.",

Pages you @-mention won’t show up as subpages of the pages they’ve been mentioned in.How can I trigger a reminder for someone else on my team?The best way to do this is to use an @-mention and @-remind on the same line.

Your projects will be intelligently mapped to their corresponding Jira issues in a related, synced issues database in Notion. This database will come with pre-populated default database views to help you get started more quickly:Active (table view): This view shows the projects you’ve synced whose status is in progress. In other words, this view doesn’t show projects that have already been completed. There are also preset filters for owner and date to make searching easier.Timeline view: This view displays project name, status, owner, and completion rate. There are also preset filters for status, owner, and date to make searching easier.Board view: This view shows your projects grouped by status (Planning,In Progress). You can customize the statuses that show in the view in the•••menu. Projects are sorted by descending priority.All (table view): This view displays all of your synced projects. There are preset filters for status, owner, and date to make searching easier.Issues databaseYour Jira issues (epic, bug, task, subtask, story) will be synced into a Notion issues database, the equivalent of a Notiontasks database. As with the synced projects database, there will be default database views created for you to help you get started more quickly:By Project (table view): This view shows all tasks, grouped by project. There are pre-set filters for status, assignee, date, and project to make searching easier.By Epic (table view): This view shows your Jira stories, tasks, and bugs grouped by Epic.Board view: This view is grouped by status and sorted by descending priority. The pre-set properties that will be displayed are assignee, project, priority, and sub-tasks,All tasks (table view): This view displays all your synced tasks. The pre-set properties that will be displayed are task name, status, assignee, date, priority, tags, and projectMine (table view): This view is filtered to only show tasks that are assigned to you. There are pre-set filters for status, date, and project.Unsupported Jira propertiesJira Sync supports most Jira properties, but not all of them. Here's the list of unsupported Jira properties:Time trackingResolutionSecurity levelΣ progressProgressRestrict toStatusCategoryRankWhile Notion doesn't support certain Jira custom properties, it does support all Jira primitive custom properties, such as string, number, select, person, and date.Sync duration and limitationsIt should only take a few minutes for the initial sync to complete, but depending on the size of your Jira projects and issues, this could take up to a few hours.Some issue fields or properties may not sync, such as rich text in property and nested multi-selects.Once the initial sync has been set up, updates to properties should be reflected in Notion in real time. If you create new properties, it could take up to 12 hours for those changes to sync.You can’t manually sync Jira with Notion — syncs happen in response to updates made in Jira.At this time, updates from Jira will sync to your Notion database in real time — not the other way around.

Visitthis articleandour pricing pageto understand how we bill you depending on the users in your workspace and the plan you're on.Note:The billing policies described in this article may not apply to sales-assisted customers. Please reach out to your account team for more information.Notion billing basicsYou're billed per memberNotion uses a billing model that charges you based on the number of seats, or licenses, you are using in your workspace. One seat is assigned to each member (not guest) in your workspace. This billing model gives you the flexibility to change which specific people join your Notion workspace as a member, without accruing new charges every time you add a new user.Here’s an example:Your team is working with three contractors, who have been added as members to your Notion instance. When their contracts are finished, you remove them from your Notion workspace.Until the end of your billing period (monthly or annual), you will still have three paid seats in Notion that you can instead fill with new contractors, new hires, interns, or anyone else who you might want to add to your workspace as a member.Learn more about workspace members and how to manage themhere →When youaddmembers to your workspace:Regardless of whether you're paying yearly or monthly, our system reviews how many members you've added and issues invoices on a monthly basis.You only pay for the fraction of the billing interval that a member belonged to your workspace.Because you pay at the beginning of every billing interval, these charges for changes made in the middle of a billing interval are added retroactively to your next invoice.On a monthly plan,this means you get your regular monthly invoice billing you for the month ahead (including new members), but the invoice will also include retroactive prorated charges for the members you added during your last billing interval.On a yearly plan, this means you'll receive an invoice at thenext monthmark (on the same calendar date you bought your plan) that will include two things:The amount due for each new member for the remainder of your year-long plan.Retroactive charges for those new members prorated based on the amount of time they've belonged to your workspace.When youremovemembers from your workspace:After removing members,you will still have access to any existing paid seats until the end of your billing interval. You can add new members to fill these seats at no additional charge.When your billing interval ends, we will recalculate the total number of paid seats in use in your workspace and bill you accordingly.Go toSettingsin your sidebar →Peopleto view how many paid seats your workspace has, how many members are currently in your workspace, and when you'll be billed next. You can easily manage the members in your workspace here.We bill you upfrontYou always pay for Notion at the start of your billing interval. If you make changes in the middle of a billing interval, we'll prorate how much you're charged, so that you only pay for what you actually used. These prorations will be applied at the start of the next billing interval.Every workspace is billed separatelyYou can create multiple workspaces per account (in other words, per email address you signed up with), in which case you'd receive multiple bills. This is why you might see multiple charges for Notion even if you have only one account.If you have multiple workspaces, you'll be billed based on how many members you have in each (on a Plus, Business, or Enterprise Plan).Even if the same people are in multiple workspaces, you'll be charged for them in each one.Your billing interval is set at the workspace levelYou could have one workspace billed annually and one billed monthly. You pay less when you choose annual billing. Everyone who joins your workspace will add an additional charge based on the interval of that workspace.Yearly vs. monthly billingYou can choose to pay for Notion on a yearly or monthly basis. This impacts both how much you pay and when you pay.Yearly billing costs less.Your plan renews automatically either once a year or once a month.If you pay yearly, your plan will renew on the same calendar day you first purchased it for all following years.If you pay monthly, the same is true of each following month.For example, a yearly plan bought on May 3 will renew May 3 the next year, and a monthly plan renews June 3.Your bill adjusts for your paid seat count either once a year or once a month.If you pay yearly, the number of licenses you are paying for will be recalculated and reflected in your billingonce a year, on the same calendar date as when you first purchased Notion.This is the only time during the year when your billing will change to reflect any paid seats that have been removed from your workspace.If you pay monthly, this recalculation will occuronce a monthon the same calendar date. Your billing will reflect any paid seats that have been removed from your workspace.When your plan renews, you will only be billed for the number of members currently in the workspace. This means your bill will go down if you have removed members since your last bill, and it will go up if you have added members since your last bill.If you expect your team size to fluctuate often, or you’d like more control over your budget, we recommend a monthly billing interval.See your plan and billing detailsNote:Only workspace owners can view and manage plans and billing.To view the details of your plan and your billing information:Go toSettingsin your sidebar.ClickBillingin the sidebar of the pop-up window.At the top, you'll see which plan you're on, how much you're paying for it either yearly or monthly, and the date it will renew.Changing your billing intervalTo change your billing interval:Go toSettingsin your sidebar.ClickBillingin the sidebar of the window that pops up.ClickUpdatenext to your current billing interval and choose what you want.Change from monthly to yearlyWhen you change from monthly to yearly, you'll establish a new billing cycle, with your plan automatically renewing on the calendar day you made this change the next year.Whatever amount of time is left on your already paid monthly cycle will be subtracted from your annual payment.For example:Let's say you’re on the Plus Plan, billed monthly.By April 15, you love Notion so much that you switch to a yearly billing interval.You already paid for part of the month, so we prorate the price of your yearly plan.Since half the month went by, we remove the unused time (the latter half of the month) from your yearly price.Change from yearly to monthlyWhen you change from yearly to monthly, the new monthly billing cycle will take effect the day your annual cycle ends. Your plan will automatically renew each month on the same calendar day going forward.View your upcoming invoiceTo view your upcoming invoice:Go toSettingsin your sidebar.SelectBilling.UnderInvoices, selectView invoice.Understanding your invoiceYour invoice might look different from what you expect, and this could be for several reasons:You've added or subtracted members from your workspace during the billing interval. Note that when you add new members to your yearly Plus, Business, or Enterprise Plan, you'll be charged foran entire yearof Notion for each of them.You changed your billing interval from monthly to yearly, or vice versa.You upgraded your plan during a billing interval. In this case, we charge you your previous rate for the time you had that plan, and your new rate for the time you had your upgraded plan. It's a blend of both!You've applied credits to your balance due.Payment methodsOn Notion for web, you can pay for your plan with a debit or credit card, or Apple Pay. If you're in Europe, we also accept payment through SEPA direct debit (not credit transfer). You can also useStripe Linkto pay with a saved card or save your card for future use on any Stripe checkout. Notion usesStripeto process payments.On an iOS device, you can pay with Apple Pay. Unfortunately, you can't make payments in the Android app at this time.If you pay with debit or credit card, you're charged upfront for the month or year you're about to spend on Notion. If you pay with SEPA direct debit, you’ll receive a debit notification email. If you have been approved to pay via ACH or bank transfer, you'll receive an emailed invoice on the first day of your billing interval.Note:All valid billing credits will expire six months from the date they are generated. Once credits have expired, they can’t be reinstated.Update your payment method & billing informationGo toSettingsin your sidebar.ClickBillingin the sidebar of the window that pops up.ClickEdit methodnext to your payment method.Enter the information for your payment method.When you’re done, clickUpdate.SEPAIf you’re using SEPA for the first time to pay for your Notion plan, note that payment must fully process before you can make any changes to your plan, add or remove AI, or update your payment method.

Send us a message if you need help!I just upgraded to a paid plan, but one of my workspaces still says it's on a free plan.Plans only apply to a single workspace and don't cover your whole account. We recommend using the fewest workspaces possible, and taking advantage of top-level pages in your sidebar to stay organized.More on that here.How can I avoid needing multiple workspaces?We've seen people create multiple workspace instead of groups to set granular permissions. For instance, they create separate workspaces for Design, Marketing, their executive team, etc. so they can't access, edit, or get distracted by each other's work. You don't need to do this. Instead:DisableWorkspace Access. That way pages won't show for people and groups who aren't specifically granted access.On every page,grant different levels of access per group. Those access levels will hold true for all the sub-pages on that page.So, for example, you could have a section of your workspace just for the engineering team. Create a group of all your engineers, then on the top-level page for that team, turn onFull Accessfor only that group. Nest pages inside that page, and only the engineering team can access them, too!How can I update my invoices to include my billing address and/or VAT number?We can update this info for you!

This allows IT administrators to better manage team access and keeps information more secure 🔐Jump to FAQsContentsWhat is SAML SSO?Benefits of SSOSetting up SAML SSO for your workspacePrerequisites for SSO with NotionEnable SAML SSO for a single workspaceLink additional workspaces to an existing SAML SSO configurationEnforce SAML SSOJust-in-Time (JIT) ProvisioningIdentity Provider (IdP) SetupEntra IDGoogleOktaOneLoginRipplingCustom SAML SSO configurationSwitching identity providersTroubleshootingNotion’s single sign-on (SSO) services are built upon the SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) 2.0 standard that permits identity managers to safely pass authorization credentials to service providers like Notion and connect your Identity Provider (IdP) and workspace(s) for an easier, more secure login experience.What is SAML SSO?SSO services permit a user to use one set of credentials (for example, a name or email address and password) to access multiple applications. The service authenticates the end user only once for all the applications the user has been given rights to and eliminates further prompts when the user switches applications during the same session.Note:SAML SSO is available for workspaces on Notion'sBusiness or Enterprise Plans.Contact sales to learn more →Benefits of SSOStreamlines user management across systems for workspace owners.Removes the need for end-users to remember and manage multiple passwords. Simplifies end-users experience by allowing them to sign in at one single access point and enjoy a seamless experience across multiple applications.Note:Only members can access a workspace via SSO. Guests are not supported.Learn more about members and guests in a Notion workspace →Setting up SAML SSO for your workspacePrerequisites for SSO with NotionYour workspace must be on a Business Plan or Enterprise Plan.Your Identity Provider (IdP) must support the SAML 2.0 standard.Only a workspace owner can configure SAML SSO for a Notion workspace.At least one domain has been verified by a workspace owner.Enable SAML SSO for a single workspaceGo toSettings & members, then select theSettingstab.In theAllow email domainssection, remove all email domains.Then select theIdentity & provisioningtab.Verify one or more domains.See instructions for domain verification here →Toggle onEnable SAML SSOand the SAML SSO Configuration modal will automatically appear and prompt you to complete the set-up.The SAML SSO Configuration modal is divided into two parts:TheAssertion Consumer Service (ACS) URLis to be entered in your Identity Provider (IdP) portalTheIdentity Provider Detailsis a field in which either an IdP URL or IdP metadata XML must be provided to Notion.For more information on where to enter and obtain this information, please refer to our IdP-specific guides below.Note:Guests are not supported with SAML SSO on Notion.Link additional workspaces to an existing SAML SSO configurationFrom the workspace where you have verified your domain and enabled SAML SSO, there is aLinked workspacessection listing all of the workspaces associated with your SAML SSO configuration.Users with a verified email address who have access to the primary workspace or one of the linked workspaces will be able to log in via SAML SSO.Sales-assisted Enterprise customers can add Enterprise workspaces to their SAML SSO configuration or remove them by reaching out to team@makenotion.com.Enforce SAML SSOOnce you have completed your configuration of SAML SSO for a single workspace, users will be able to log in via SAML SSO in addition to other log-in methods such as username/password and Google Authentication.To ensure users can only log in using SAML SSO and no other method, update theLogin methodtoOnly SAML SSO. Once this happens, workspace users will be logged out and required to log back in using SAML SSO.SAML SSO will only be enforced for users who use your verified domain and have access to the primary workspace or a linked workspace.Guests invited to pages in a Notion workspace can’t use SAML SSO to login. Instead, they’ll always use their e-mail and password or log in with Google or Apple.Workspace owners will always have the option to bypass SAML SSO by using their email and password credentials. This is to allow them to access Notion in the event of IdP/SAML failure. They will be able to log in and disable or update their configuration.Just-in-Time (JIT) ProvisioningNotion supports Just-in-Time provisioning when using SAML SSO. This allows someone signing in via SAML SSO to join the workspace automatically as a member.To enable Just-in-Time provisioning:InSettings & members→Identity & provisioning, make sure thatAutomatic account creationis enabled.Note:We don’t recommend enabling Just-in Time provisioning if you are using SCIM. Having an “allowed email domain” in place allows users on that domain to join the workspace so there could be a mismatch between membership in their Identity Providers and Notion.Identity Provider (IdP) SetupThese are instructions for setting up Notion SAML SSO with Entra ID (formerly Azure), Google, Okta, and OneLogin.

You can do so using this online tool:https://www.samltool.com/validate_xml.phpNote that we do not support theEntitiesDescriptorelement. If your IdP's metadata contains this element, extract the containedEntityDescriptorelement and try again.FAQsWhy is the current Enable SAML SSO greyed out?The most common reason is that you have not yet verified ownership of a domain. If this is the case, you will notice that you either don’t have any domains listed in the verify email domain section or the domain is pending verification.For next steps,refer to our instructions on how to complete domain verification here →Why can’t I edit the SAML SSO settings?The most common reason is that you are trying to modify the verified domains or SSO configuration from a linked workspace which is a workspace that is already associated with another SSO configuration.In linked workspaces, all domain management and SSO configuration settings are read-only. To modify the SSO configuration or remove this workspace from the SSO configuration, you must have access to the primary workspace. The name of the primary workspace can be found at the top of theIdentity & Provisioningsettings tab.Why do I need to verify a domain to enable SSO?We ask that the email domain ownership is validated to ensure that only the owner of the domain can customize how their users log into Notion.Having trouble setting up SSO? Here are some common issues:Try using a URL instead of an XML.We recommend testing the setup process with a test account before enforcing it for users.If neither of these options help, reach out to support atteam@makenotion.com.Why should I remove email domains from the “Allowed Email Domains” setting before configuring SAML SSO for my workspace?The “Allowed Email Domain” setting allows users with the selected domains to access your workspace without being provisioned via your IdP. To ensure that only users provisioned via your IdP can access your SAML-enabled workspace, disable this feature by removing all email addresses from the “Allowed Email Domain” list.Can I still log in to Notion if my identity provider is out of service?Yes, even with SAML enforced, Workspace owners have the option to log in with email. Thereafter, a Workspace owner can change the SAML configuration to disableEnforce SAMLso users may log in with email again.Are profile photos transmitted to Notion from the IdP?Yes, profilePhoto is an optional custom attribute. You may assign this attribute to a corresponding attribute in your IdP, provided the attribute contains the URL to an image. If the profilePhoto field is set, this image will replace the avatar in Notion when the user signs in using SAML SSO.How do I allow admins of other workspaces in my SAML configuration create new workspaces?Only the admins of your primary workspace will be able to create new workspaces using your verified domain(s). Please reach out to our support team (team@makenotion.com) to switch your primary SAML workspace to another linked workspace in your SAML configuration.",

This unlocks domain management settings likeconfiguring SAML SSOfor your workspace, building Notion integrations usinglink previews, andcontrolling who can create workspaces(for Enterprise Plans only).Domain verification does not impact your billing.Verify a domain for your workspaceNote: To do this, you must be a workspace owner on a Business or Enterprise plan.InSettings & members, navigate to theIdentity & provisioningtab and complete the following steps to verify your domain.Within theDomain managementsection, click theAdd domainbutton.Type in the domain that you wish to verify and click theNextbutton.The domain will be added to the list of your verified domains in aPendingverification (designated with the color yellow).Update the DNS record.After updating the DNS record,  ClickVerifyto notify Notion to check your DNS record.Once verification is complete, you’ll receive a confirmation email and the domain will be displayed in green.Note:Typically, a change in the DNS record takes only minutes to propagate; however, there are cases where it may take up to 72 hours.You must verify a domain within one week of adding the domain. After a week, the verification code will expire and you’ll have to repeat the steps above.Verify a domain for an integrationIf you’re building an integration with Notion, like Link Previews, you’ll need to verify your domain in the integration management page (this action will not take place in Notion).You can find the full instructions in ourDeveloper Guides →Workspace creation permissionsPrerequisites for customizing workspace creation permissionsWorkspace must be on the Enterprise Plan.You must be a workspace owner.You have verified at least one domain.Instructions for domain verification can be found above →Customize permissions for workspace creation using your domain(s)You can customize permissions for who can create new workspaces using your verified domain(s).InSettings & members, go toIdentity & provisioningand thenWorkspace creation.SelectAnyoneto allow any user with your verified domain to create a new workspace.SelectWorkspace ownersto prevent users with your verified domain from creating new workspaces.Note:The default setting for workspace creation permissions once a domain is verified is workspace owners only.Enabling Domain ClaimOnce a domain is verified, workspace owners on the Enterprise Plan can transfer, delete, or claim ownership over non-Enterprise workspaces created by users with their verified domain.Prerequisites for viewing claimable workspacesYou must be a workspace owner on the Enterprise Plan.Verified domain is a non-educational domain.What workspaces are eligible?Single-member workspaceThe workspace creator’s email belongs to the verified corporate domain.Multi-member workspaceThe workspace creator’s email belongs to the verified corporate domain (the creator does not need to be a current member of the space).At least one current workspace owner (either the creator or someone else) is using the verified corporate email address.Workspace is not on the Enterprise Plan.Notification periodOnce a workspace owner verifies a domain, an automated email will be sent to all workspace owners of workspaces created with that domain, notifying them that their workspaces are eligible to be claimed.During this 14 day notification period, workspace owners can only request ownership transfers on single-member workspaces. They will be unable to delete single-member workspaces or claim multi-member workspaces.After a domain is verified, users who create new workspaces with a verified domain will be notified upon creation that their workspace is eligible to be claimed.View claimable workspacesOnce a domain is verified, Enterprise workspace owners can view all non-enterprise workspaces created by users with their verified domain.

We'll help out.I'm trying to enable the integration in Slack's App Directory, but it just takes me to Notion's homepage.Sorry for the confusion 🙈You can't enable the integration from Slack. You'll need to turn it on inside Notion with the instructions on this page.What permissions are granted when the Slack integration is enabled?Notion's integration with Slack operates on a per-page basis. When you enable the Slack integration for a specific page in your Notion workspace, you're granting Notion access to publish updates to the Slack channel of your choosing.Can I add more than one login for a link preview integration?You can! You can do so viaSettings & Members→My connections. For the desired integration, select “Connect another account”.Note: Some applications do not support multi-account login in the browser (e.g. GitHub), so you might need to logout of whichever account is currently logged in on your browser to be prompted to login with a different account.We’ll determine which of your accounts to use to preview given resources and show an error if none of them are successful.I’m receiving a general  “Can’t load preview” error in my link preview.Run through these steps to try to resolve.Confirm you’ve authenticated with the correct account for the resource.Confirm no access restrictions for your organization.Delete your integration in Notion via theMy connectionsettings.

  "HIPAA configuration (continued)\n\nHIPAA configurationIn this ArticleLearn about how to make your Notion workspace HIPAA compliant, and how to enable HIPAA compliance 🏥Jump to FAQsContentsConfiguring Notion for HIPAAEnable HIPAA complianceDeactivate HIPAA complianceThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) is a US federal law that was enacted in 1996 that requires the protection and confidential handling of protected health information (PHI) by covered entities such as healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as their business associates.This article provides users required product configurations to make their Notion workspace HIPAA compliant.Note:Notion's Business Associate Agreement (BAA) governs the protection of Personal Health Information (PHI) that is stored in the Notion Service. To be eligible to sign Notion’s BAA, you must subscribe to our Enterprise Plan.Notion Calendar and any Notion Calendar features are not covered by the BAA and therefore may not be used or deployed in a manner that processes protected health information.To the extent that any language on this page and language found in the BAA conflict at any time, the BAA shall control.Configuring Notion for HIPAAHIPAA Technical Safeguard RequirementsNotion's Supporting ConfigurationsAccess ControlImplement technical policies and procedures for electronic information systems that maintain electronic protected health information to allow access only to those persons or software programs that have been granted access rights.Notion’s SAML SSO is built upon the SAML 2.0 standard, connecting your Identity Provider (IdP) and workspace(s) for an easier, more secure login experience. Notion supports official configurations for SAML SSO with: Azure, Google, Gusto, Okta, OneLogin, and Rippling.To get started using SAML SSO with Notion, you'll need to complete the following steps:Verify domain(s):To use advanced security features, you must verify ownership of your email domain. This is an automated process that involves adding a TXT record onto your domain’s DNS to verify your ownership of it.Enable SAML SSO:This will toggle the feature on and complete the configuration. For more information on completing the SAML SSO configuration, please refer tothis article.Change default login method:Once SAML SSO is enabled for the first time, the default login method will be set toAny method, meaning that users have the option of logging in via SAML or their normal login method. By setting this toOnly SAML SSO, this enforces SAML as the login method for your workspace for managed users with verified company emails.Link additional workspaces:If you have more than one workspace you’d like to configure with SSO, you can do so by reaching out toteam@makenotion.com.Once properly configured, any members signing into your workspace(s) will need to use the verified domain and will need to be authenticated through your identity provider. Enterprise workspace owners are able to bypass by using an alternative login method in case there’s an IdP/SAML SSO failure.Unique User IdentificationAssign a unique name and/or number for identifying and tracking user identity.Notion has a SCIM API which can be used to provision, manage, and de-provision members and groups. Workspace owners can find the required API key by going toSettings & members→Security & identity→SCIM Configurationand clicking to view the token.Please seeour SCIM documentationfor the latest information on how you can interact with Notion’s SCIM API.

  "Notion AI security & privacy practices (continued)\n\nNotion AI security & privacy practicesIn this ArticleAt Notion, we want to be transparent with our customers about our products and how we use AI to enhance our users’ experience. Below is an overview of Notion’s AI functionality and related security and privacy practices 🔒ContentsWhat is Notion AI?How does Notion AI work?Who are Notion’s Large Language Model ProvidersHow does Autofill work?How does AI assistant work?How is my data protected?Does Notion AI respect existing permissions?How is Customer Data protected when sent to AI Subprocessors?Will my data be used to train any models?How is Customer Data segregated?What are the data retention obligations of third-party AI providers?What compliance standards does Notion AI meet?What controls can be added?Can data loss prevention (DLP) be configured to alert for data being used by Notion AI?What are the legal considerations?Are there rules against what I can do with Notion AI?Who owns the rights to content generated by Notion AI?What is Notion AI?Notion AI is a collection of AI products and features, which currently includes*:AI assistant:Boost your productivity with instant answers to your questions as well as help with generating written content and brainstorming, all by using information from across your Notion workspace and the web.Autofill:Generate text across many pages in a database simultaneously by writing a custom prompt or selecting a pre-configured prompt.Notion AI features appear seamlessly in your workspace but leverage technology from several AI Subprocessors to provide you with the service. Check out ourSubprocessor pagefor a complete list of our current Subprocessors, and learn more about how Notion uses AI inthis article.*Notion AI will continue expanding to include more features over time.How does Notion AI work?Who are Notion’s Large Language Model Providers?Notion currently utilizes various large language models (LLMs) hosted by Notion as well as by organizations such as Anthropic and OpenAI. We continuously evaluate LLM providers and their models to provide the highest quality experience to our Notion AI users. Any third parties that process Customer Data will be published in ourSubprocessor page.How do I subscribe to new Subprocessor notifications?Customers may sign up to receive notification of new Subprocessors by e-mailingteam@makenotion.comwith the subject “Subscribe to New Subprocessors.” Once a customer has signed up to receive new Subprocessor notifications, Notion will provide that customer with notice of any new Subprocessors before authorizing the new Subprocessor to process Customer Data. For additional information, please see ourData Processing Addendum.How does Autofill work?When you interact with the Notion AI to set up an autofill property, several steps occur in the background:Notion receives a prompt from a user.Data relevant to the prompt is sent to an AI LLM Subprocessor, which produces an output to send back to Notion.Notion then processes the LLM’s output so that it adheres to the right format and language and displays the output to the user.How is my data protected?When sending data to our AI LLM Subprocessors, the data is encrypted in transit using TLS 1.2 or greater, and no Customer Data is used to train the model.All our AI LLM Subprocessors retain data for only 30 days or fewer before deletion.Only data the user has access to on the specific page where Autofill is used will be sent to AI LLM Subprocessors to generate the output, meaning that the generated outputs provided to the user will not incorporate any data to which the user did not already have access.How does AI assistant work?Notion AI is a personalized assistant powered by GPT-4. It can search across your workspace, create and edit content, and chat with you about any topic.The AI assistant works in two key phases:Creating embeddings.Generating responses.What are embeddings?Embeddings are numerical representations of text or documents. These representations capture the meaning and context of the text in a multidimensional space, where similar topics have similar numerical representations. By using embeddings, vector search algorithms can efficiently compare and find similarities between different pieces of text or documents. In the case of Notion’s AI assistant feature, embeddings are created from workspace content to enable the system to provide accurate and relevant responses to user questions.Here is an example of an embedding fromOpenAI:[-0.02541878,-0.0104167685,-0.0015037002,...,-0.004155378,-0.00043069973,-0.01679479]How are embeddings created?For each page in your workspace, we generate an embedding by using an OpenAI zero-retention embeddings API.Notion receives an embedding for each Notion page and stores it in a vector database (e.g., Pinecone), which ultimately is used to find that original block when it is relevant to providing a response to the user.How are embeddings used to generate responses?Notion receives a question from a user.The request is passed to an LLM Subprocessor. If the request does not require searching the Notion workspace, the LLM will generate a response at this point and skip the rest of the process. If the user’s request requires searching their workspace, the LLM generates a search query most relevant for the user request.The query is passed to a vector database, where a list pages is found based on relevance to the query.Notion sends the query — and the pages identified by the vector database — to a Notion-hosted LLM where the pages are refined and ranked by relevance to the query.The query, refined list of pages, and ranking of pages are processed by our LLM Subprocessors to generate a response that fulfills the user’s request.Notion processes the output to adhere to the right format and language and displays the output to the user.How are embeddings protected?Despite embeddings only being a numerical representation of Customer Data, Notion still treats embeddings with the same level of security and privacy considerations as Customer Data. All our Customer Data commitments outlined in our Master Service Agreement (MSA) and Data Processing Agreements (DPA) apply to embeddings. View ourTerms and Privacy Pagefor more information.We store embeddings with vector databases like Pinecone. These vector databases have been vetted by our security team as well as an external auditor to obtain their SOC2 Type II certification.How is my data protected?Does Notion AI respect existing permissions?Yes, Notion AI honors existing permissions. The LLM used to generate AI responses for a user cannot see or use any information to which that user does not already have access.How is Customer Data protected when sent to AI Subprocessors?Notion AI is designed to protect your Customer Data and prevent information leaks to other users of the service.Prior to engaging any third-party Subprocessor or vendor, Notion evaluates their privacy, security, and confidentiality practices, and executes an agreement implementing its applicable security, privacy, and legal obligations. All Subprocessors are monitored and reviewed at least annually to ensure continued compliance with Notion’s security and privacy expectations. This includes reviewing documents such as attestation reports, penetration tests, and other artifacts based on the Subprocessor’s criticality and other risk factors. As part of the onboarding and ongoing reviews, technology security questionnaires are distributed to vendors and are required to be completed. Significant public security events are also assessed to protect the supply chain attack surface.When we send your Customer Data to third parties, it is encrypted in-transit using TLS 1.2 or greater.For more information about how Notion processes your data, please refer to ourData Processing Addendum.Will my data be used to train any models?By default, Notion and its AI Subprocessors do not use Customer Data to train any models. We specifically have contractual agreements in place with our AI Subprocessors that prohibit the use of Customer Data to train their models.Your use of Notion AI does not grant Notion any right or license to your Customer Data to train our machine learning models.How is Customer Data segregated?Individual customer accounts are kept separate in our production environment. We do not mix or process data from different customers together during AI processing. This means we do not expose your data to other Notion customers.What are the data retention obligations of third-party AI providers?Notion AISubprocessorshave data retention policies that allow Notion to meetour obligations to customers for the processing of data.When using Notion AI assistant and Autofill, our LLM providers utilize zero data retention for Enterprise plan workspaces, so no data is stored with LLM providers. For all non-Enterprise plan workspaces, LLM providers only retain Customer Data for 30 days or fewer before deletion.Notion's AI assistant is additionally powered by OpenAI's embeddings. OpenAI does not retain any Customer Data through their embeddings service.Embeddings stored in vector databases are deleted within 60 days from when the page or workspace is deleted.If a user deletes a Notion page or Notion workspace, we can restore the content within 30 days. After 30 days, the data is deleted and unrecoverable. This includes any AI-generated data and embeddings. For more information about deleting or restoring your data, please refer tothis article.What compliance standards does Notion AI meet?Notion AI is included in the scope of Notion’s SOC 2 Type 2 report and ISO 27001 certification, demonstrating our commitment to various regulatory and industry standards.Notion AI enables HIPAA compliance by utilizing LLM providers' zero-retention APIs and allows for the processing of protected health information (PHI).What controls can be added?Can data loss prevention (DLP) be configured to alert for data being used by Notion AI?Customers can trigger data loss prevention (DLP) alerts for sensitive content in their Notion workspace using third-party integration partners on our Enterprise plan. That will include content in an AI prompt and the content generated by AI. Learn more about our DLP integrationshere.What are the legal considerations?Are there rules against what I can do with Notion AI?TheNotion AI Supplementary Termsapply to your usage of Notion AI. In addition, Notion’sContent & Use Policyapplies to any content on Notion, including content generated by Notion AI. Violating these terms can result in removal of your content or suspension of access to your workspace.Who owns the rights to content generated by Notion AI?Notion does not claim ownership of your input or the generated output. This is addressed in theNotion AI Supplementary Termsin the \"Input and Output\" section:You may provide input to be processed by Notion AI (“Input”), and receive output generated and returned by Notion AI based on the Input (“Output”). When you use Notion AI, Input and Output are your Customer Data.You can also reference our standarddata protection practices.",

Notion Calendar’s blocking features make it easy to block events across your various calendars. For example, Notion Calendar can put a block on your work calendar for an event you have on your personal calendar, so people know you’re busy without being able to see your personal commitments. You can block single events or auto-block whole calendars.Block an event or an entire calendarOn desktop or web:Right-click an event and selectBlock on calendar.Select the calendar you want to create a block in.To create a block for a single event, selectThis event. Alternatively, you can selectAll events from {calendar name}to set up auto-blocking. For example, if you are creating a block on your work calendar for an event on your personal calendar, you can synchronize the two calendars so that all future events from your personal calendar will be blocked on your work calendar.Choose toInclude detailsfrom the original calendar event in the block, or simplyShow as busy. This will apply to future blocks if you choose to auto-block.If you manage your time across two calendars, like work and personal, use event blocking to automatically block time on each.To see what details you’ve shared on a calendar block, right-click the original event and select Block on calendar. There will be a🔒next to the calendar where the block was set up — if the lock is open, that means the event’s details have been shared. If the lock is closed, that means the event’s details are hidden.Alternatively, you can hide the original calendar from view by selecting the eye icon next to its name in the left sidebar. Then, you can find the block on your other calendar and see its details.Remove blockingYou can remove blocks the same way you created them. Right-click a blocked event and unselect the calendar where the block lives. You can unblock a single event, or turn off auto-blocking by unblocking all events.You may want to undo auto-blocking for a calendar that you no longer have access to.

There are three types of conferencing integrations in Notion Calendar:Default integrations: Conferencing that is available to you by default from your calendar provider. Google Meet, which is linked to Google Calendar, is one example.Connected integrations: An integration you can set up by logging into a conferencing tool. New events you create on desktop or web will generate new links for this conference tool from within Notion Calendar. Zoom is an example of a connected integration that Notion Calendar supports.Custom integrations: You can add a stable conferencing link for a conferencing tool of your choice by going toSettings→Conferencing→Conferencing providers→Add. You can give your integration a name. This conferencing tool will show up in the conferencing dropdown when you create events. Any stable links will work, but Notion Calendar can detect popular services, includingAround,BlueJeans,Doxy.me,Microsoft Teams,Skype,Webex, andWhereby.Note:If an event contains conferencing links in both its description and conferencing field, you’ll be taken to the link from the event’s description when you join a meeting from Notion Calendar.Set a default conferencing optionA default conferencing option allows you to automatically add conferencing to an event that has at least one other participant when you’re using Notion Calendar on desktop.
